## What is Click to Build? ðŸš€

Click to Build is a visual Roblox Studio plugin for rapidly creating paths, walls, shapes, and modular structures.
It streamlines building with click-to-place workflows, live previews, and precise placement tools.

## What problem does this solve? ðŸ§©

-   Manually placing and aligning parts is slow and error-prone
-   Rebuilding corners, bevels, and arcs by hand is tedious
-   Keeping consistent spacing, measurements, and snap alignment is hard
-   Previewing outcomes without destructive edits is difficult
-   Repeating patterns (walls, fences, grids) require too many steps

## Why it helps âœ¨

-   Build in minutes, not hours, with pointâ€‘based placement and live previews
-   Automatic corner handling (Round, Bevel, Fill, Touch, None) for clean turns
-   Consistent alignment with grid/surface snapping and lockâ€‘currentâ€‘plane
-   Iterate safely with nonâ€‘destructive previews and full undo/redo
-   Reuse look & feel via Template copying; optional unionâ€‘onâ€‘finish for visuals
-   Scale efficiently: fewer clicks for long runs (paths, fences, walls, grids)
-   Model flows: Magic Merge and alternating offsets reduce seams/zâ€‘fighting
-   Keyboard shortcuts and focused UI speed up repetitive actions

## Main areas

-   [Shape Builder](/docs/shape-builder): draw primitives and custom geometry
-   [Model Placer](/docs/model-placer): assemble and align multi-part models
-   [Structure Builder](/docs/structure-builder): generate repeated patterns and layouts
