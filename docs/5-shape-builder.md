## What it is ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Draw primitives and custom geometry directly in the viewport with live previews, snapping, and precise controls.

## When to use üß©

-   Blocking out levels and paths
-   Creating walls, floors, ramps, wedges, cylinders, sectors, and spheres
-   Making clean, repeatable geometry with consistent dimensions

## Workflow üõ†Ô∏è

1. Choose a shape and draw mode in the panel.
2. Enable grid or surface snapping as needed.
3. Click in the viewport to place points.
4. You will see a preview as you set points.
5. You can change settings while placing points. The preview updates accordingly.
6. Building will end after placing the last point.
7. You have created a shape.

## Supported shapes

![Available Shapes](/img/shape-list.png)

### Shape - Block

![Shape Block Settings](/img/shapes/block-settings.png)

#### Draw Modes

##### 4 - points (Side-Side-Height)

![Shape Block](/img/shapes/shape-block.gif)

##### 3 - points (Center to Corner)

Good when working with Grid, especially when creating many blocks and minimizing clicks.

### Shape - Cylinder

![Shape Cylinder Settings](/img/shapes/cylinder-settings.png)

This creates a Roblox `Part` where the `Shape` property is `Cylinder`.

#### Draw Modes

You can choose from different draw modes to easily create cylinders for each scenario with accuracy.

##### Radius From Center

When you know where you want the center of the cylinder to be.

![Shape Cylinder](/img/shapes/shape-cylinder-radius-from-center.gif)

##### Height From To

When you want to create a cylinder on a surface, for example as a pipe.

![Shape Cylinder](/img/shapes/shape-cylinder-height-from-to.gif)

##### Radius From To

When you want to create a cylinder so edges span from one point to another.

![Shape Cylinder](/img/shapes/shape-cylinder.gif)

### Shape - Sphere

![Shape Sphere Settings](/img/shapes/sphere-settings.png)

#### Draw Modes

You can choose from different draw modes to easily create spheres for each scenario with accuracy.

##### Height from surface

When you know how high you want the sphere to be in relation to other shapes in your build.

![Shape Sphere](/img/shapes/shape-sphere.gif)

##### Radius at surface

When you know the width of the sphere. Especially good when working with Grid.

### Shape - Polygon

![Shape Polygon Settings](/img/shapes/polygon-settings.png)

Set as many points for your polygon as you like. You can undo or go to "Edit Mode" if you misplaced your point. To finish building go near first point and click the "Close loop" button (Or press Space any time to close loop). Your last and first point will be connected perfectly. And then you can define the height. And after that you have created a polygon shape.

#### Triangulation Algorithm

You can set different triangulation algorithms. The default is fine in most cases. If a polygon is not drawn correctly, try changing the algorithm:

-   Ear-clipping (Default)
-   Delaunay (Better Triangles - does not create long and narrow wedges)
-   Simple (Non‚Äëconcave ‚Äî not needed in most cases; does not work with concave polygons)
-   Grid Based (Experimental)

When the "Visualize part" setting is enabled, you can see the difference in wedge generation:

-   Ear-clipping
    ![Shape Polygon Ear Clipping](/img/shapes/polygon-ear-clipping.png)

-   Delaunay
    ![Shape Polygon Delaunay](/img/shapes/polygon-delaunay.png)

-   Simple

#### Edit Mode

When you enable "Edit Mode" for a polygon, you can remove, move, and add points:

![Shape Polygon Simple](/img/shapes/polygon-edit-mode.gif)

-   Remove point: Click a point; when selected it turns red and you can press Backspace/Delete to remove it.

-   Add point: Click an edge to create a point, then click & drag the point. Or click & drag directly on the edge to create and move a point immediately.

-   Move point: Click & drag a point to move it; release when done.

#### Edit selected polygon

You can edit an already created polygon. It does not have to be created with this plugin. It can even be a plain `Part`.
Select all the parts that make up a polygon, or a folder/model that contains those parts as children.
Then press "Edit Selected Polygon ‚úèÔ∏è". It regenerates all corner points including the height point and goes into Edit Mode. Then you can change height or move/remove/add points. When done, either:

-   Exit "Edit Mode" by unchecking Edit Mode checkbox (or using shortcut Shift+G)
-   Click "Finish Building" (or using shortcut Shift+T)

Note: Separate the UnionOperation before editing; otherwise you‚Äôll be editing its bounding box.

#### Boundary polygon from selection

Good if you want to connect two shapes that are not connected.
Select any number of parts, click "Boundary Polygon from Selection ‚ûï", and a polygon with boundary points around your selection is created. Define height and you are done.

#### Exact polygon from selection

This functionality is a predecessor to "Edit Selected Polygon". It creates a copy of the selected polygon and lets you define the height. Of course, you can go into Edit Mode yourself. This might be removed at some point, or become an "Edit Selected Polygon" that copies instead of editing. The idea is you could do low‚Äëpoly mountains by creating a base polygon, then copying and editing the height and some points to gradually go higher.

### Shape - Triangle

![Shape Triangle](/img/shapes/shape-triangle.gif)

### Shape - Wedge

![Shape Wedge Settings](/img/shapes/wedge-settings.png)

#### Draw Mode

##### Low Side First

![Shape Wedge](/img/shapes/shape-wedge.gif)

##### High Side First

Use High Side First when you want to add a wedge against a part and can snap to part corners for perfect alignment.

![Shape Wedge](/img/shapes/wedge-high-side-first.gif)

##### Triangle First

If you need a wedge on its side.

![Shape Wedge](/img/shapes/wedge-triangle-first.gif)

### Shape - Corner

![Shape Corner Wedge](/img/shapes/shape-corner-wedge.gif)

### Shape - Sector

![Shape Sector Settings](/img/shapes/sector-settings.png)

![Shape Sector](/img/shapes/shape-sector.gif)

#### Segments in circle

This is the segment count for a full circle. For a quarter sector, it uses one quarter of the segments. For example, with 60 segments, a 90¬∞ sector uses 15.
Default is 60. Here is one with 6 segments:

![Shape Sector](/img/shapes/sector-6-segments.gif)

#### Inverse Sector

Change the direction of sector cutting: left vs right.

### Shape - Donut

![Shape Donut Settings](/img/shapes/donut-settings.png)

![Shape Donut](/img/shapes/shape-donut.gif)

#### Segments in circle

This is the segment count for a full circle. For a quarter segment, it uses one quarter of the segments. For example, with 60 segments, it uses 15.
Default is 60. Here is one with 6 segments:

![Shape Donut](/img/shapes/donut-6-segments.gif)

Here is one with 3 segments and "Custom inner radius":

![Shape Donut](/img/shapes/donut-3-segments.gif)

#### Custom inner radius

You define the inner radius after setting the full radius.

#### Predefined inner radius

You can define the percentage that the hole will be from the width. Default 0.5, so 50%.
