## Unreleased ðŸ§ª

-   EditableMesh as a result from Shape Builder and Puncher

## 1.1.0

-   Grid Mode â€” Camera: Lock the grid to a plane in front of the camera with configurable distance and axis (X/Y/Z/None). Improves freeâ€‘space drawing without relying on a surface.
-   Align grid to current edge: Rotate and position the grid to the active edge direction for precise edgeâ€‘aligned placement in both Shape Builder and Model Builder.

-   Demos: [Camera grid mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_SBb4Cul5Q), [Align grid to edge (Model Builder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiYGyTu9LJc), [Align grid to edge (Shape Builder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvRp8FfR1eQ)

## 1.0.9

-   Punch feature: Subtract shapes from parts (Shape Builder)
-   Supports cutters: Rectangle, Cylinder, Sphere, Wedge, CornerWedge, Polygon, Triangle, Sector, Donut
-   Modes:
    -   Cut Parts into multiple parts (Rectangle only) with options: Cut from Wedge, Keep Cutout, fallback to solid modeling for nonâ€‘cuttable parts
    -   Use Solid Modeling to punch holes (all nonâ€‘rectangle shapes)
-   Scope options: All touching parts or Only selected parts
-   Solid Modeling option: Merge into a single union
-   Note: Polygon, Donut, and Sector cutters are experimental due to triangulation accuracy
-   Demos: [Demo of Rectangle cutter cutting part into wedges as parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vBB56djae0), [Demo of all other shapes cutting using Solid Modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrOoAEcGit8)

## 1.0.8

## 1.0.7

-   Polygon from Selection:
    -   Boundary polygon (convex hull) from selected parts
    -   Exact polygon via boundary face detection; finds external boundaries and connects them into polygon points
-   Grid Snap Control: hold Shift to temporarily disable grid snapping while building (with visible indicator)

## 1.0.0
